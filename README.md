# Load Reddit Images Directly

Chrome extension to bypass reddits annoying page when viewing images.

### Download the extension for Chrome

### What it does

Bypasses this page by modifying the request headers.  
We get straight to the image source as expected when chosing "open image in new tab".

### Firefox extension working similarly

[nopperl](https://github.com/nopperl/load-reddit-images-directly) made a firefox extension that uses deprecated manifest v2 technology so I rewrote it to work for chrome.
